<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic, valid HTML5 document.</p>
    <!-- Heading Level 1 -->
    <h1>Introduction to HTML Structure</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <p>
        The HTML document object model (DOM) forms the core structure of any webpage. It starts with the mandatory 
        `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which tells the browser which version of HTML to expect. Following this, the 
        `<html>` element wraps all content and usually specifies the document's language using the `lang` attribute.
    </p>

    <!-- Heading Level 2 -->
    <h2>The Importance of Head and Body</h2>

    <!-- Second Paragraph -->
    <p>
        The document is logically divided into two main parts: the `<head>` and the `<body>`. The `<head>` contains 
        metadata—information about the document, such as its title, character set (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`), and 
        links to external stylesheets or scripts. This content is generally not visible to the user but is vital 
        for browser function and search engine optimization.
    </p>

    <!-- Third Paragraph -->
    <p>
        In contrast, the `<body>` contains all the elements that are visually rendered to the user. This includes text, 
        links, images, multimedia, and interactive forms. Proper structuring of the body content is crucial for both 
        readability and accessibility, ensuring a smooth experience for all visitors.
    </p>

    <!-- Heading Level 3 -->
    <h3>Hierarchical Headings and Content Flow</h3>

    <!-- Fourth Paragraph -->
    <p>
        Headings, ranging from `<h1>` (the main topic) down to `<h6>`, establish a clear hierarchy for the document. 
        It is considered best practice to only use a single `<h1>` tag per page to represent the primary theme. 
        Lower-level headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) should be used to organize sub-sections logically, much like 
        chapters and subchapters in a book. This structure greatly aids assistive technologies and content parsers.
    </p>

    <!-- Clickable Image -->
    <p>
        Below is an example of an image that is also a clickable link, demonstrating the use of both the `<a>` and `<img>` tags.
